## Overview
> P04PAS - POAP 4 PEACE Artist Submbission (yourCollectible)

> HEART - Help Empower Artist Repost Token (yourToken)

Intention: Allow users to vote on Artist Submissions to a Collection with HEART tokens.  

### Ideas
* enable vendor so hearts are purchased - (re-evalate KN03 )

### TODO
* T01: automate (or something) the minting : ~~KN02~~
* T02: add time limits to vote
* T04: > add WL upload and register. WL is currently hardcoded to deployer and contracts - WL could/should? be hodlrs of a token.
* T05: allows one Register(address) at a time - would be nice to extend the registration 
* T06: transfer ownership of collectible to moderator and display collectibles from moderator : KI05

#### Notes
- removed counter for minting and always use LastMintIndex (T01)

### Known Issues (KNnn) / BUGs 
* KI01: when testing it waits for an event in the browser after minting to continue the test (on localhost anyway)
* ~~KI02: if webpage is refreshed the counter resets and minting a new item will revert to 0.~~
* KI03: when voting: token does not transfer to collectible (code commented)
* KI04: heart counts do not update after Heart Art action 
* * KI04a Voter Address HEART count 
* ** KI04a1 - after register click
* ** KI04a2 - on page refresh
* ** KI04a3 - after voting
* * KI04b Heart Count below Artist Submission next to P04PAS ID 
* KI05: yourCollectible owner is the minter - should be transfered to moderator
* KI06: long load time

2022.04.09 Feedback:
* KI07: Transactions need signing - especially because they are spending eth on gas OR better yet just sign and no gas
* ** KI07a On Register
* ** KI07b On Heart Art
* **KI08: not all nfts display for everyone - some appear as broken links**
* KI09: add instructions for use
* KI10: maybe hide the burner wallet?

#### KI08 Notes
- rate limited in UI here: const jsonManifestBuffer = await getFromIPFS(ipfsHash); 
- modified to build the uri in the collectible contract


### 🖨 Minting 

> ✏️ Mint the POAP For PEACE Artist Submission NFTs if not already minted. Click the `MINT NFT` button in the YourCollectables tab.  The current collection is 27 items and it should throw an error if addition items are minted.  

Note: P04PAS Collectibles have already been minted.

### Register
> Click Register to add address to Votes mapping. This will also issue 2 HEART tokens to registering address - this is displayed next to the Register button

### Heart ART
> Click the Heart Art below the Artist Submission up to the number of issued HEART tokens.  The same or multiple submissions can be Hearted.
