# Overview

Intention: Allow users to vote on Artist Submissions to a Collection with HEART tokens.  



# TODO
* add time limits to vote
* add WL upload and register.  WL is currently hardcoded to deployer and contracts - WL could/should? be hodlrs of a token.
* allows one Register(address) at a time - would be nice to extend the registration 
* automate the minting



# Known Issues
* when testing it waits for an event in the browser after minting to continue the test (on localhost anyway)
* if webpage is refreshed the counter resets and minting a new item will revert to 0.
* when voting: token does not transfer to collectible (code commented)



# Contracts (From Challenge )
* > YourCollectible - (Challenge 0) : POAP for PEACE Artist Submissions (P04PAS)
* > YourToken - (Challege 2) : HEART token used to vote
* > Vendor - (Challenge 2) : Hold and Issue HEART tokens (currently no cost)
* > Moderator (this) : manange Registration and Voting



# üñ® Minting 

> ‚úèÔ∏è Mint the POAP For PEACE Artist Submission NFTs if not already minted. Click the `MINT NFT` button in the YourCollectables tab.  The current collection is 27 items and it should throw an error if addition items are minted.
